Streamlining Student Schedules with Prolog
This project offers a smart solution to one of the most persistent challenges in education: crafting efficient student schedules.
Imagine a world where students effortlessly navigate their academic commitments, free from the headache of overlapping classes and packed timetables. That's precisely what this program delivers. It's designed to intelligently build personalized course schedules, ensuring that every student can pursue their studies without conflict and with the breathing room of a balanced week.   
Here's how it makes a difference:
•	It takes the complexity out of schedule creation.
•	It dynamically prevents those frustrating class clashes.
•	It thoughtfully carves out time for students to recharge, guaranteeing two free days each week.
•	It actively helps pinpoint the ideal slots for courses to maximize learning.   
At the heart of this system is a carefully constructed knowledge base (studentKB.pl) that understands the relationships between students, courses, and time.
To jump right in:
1.	Grab the project files, including the Prolog code and the studentKB.pl file.
2.	Set up your Prolog environment (SWI-Prolog is a great choice).
3.	Place studentKB.pl in the same directory as your main project file. Then, weave it into your program by adding this line at the very beginning:
Prolog
:- consult('studentKB').
4.	Unleash the power of Prolog by running the example queries. Watch as it generates schedules and reveals optimal time slots!
If you need a guiding hand:
•	This documentation and the original project details are your go-to resources.
•	The wider world of Prolog tutorials and documentation is there to support your deeper exploration.
